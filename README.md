# Portfolio Optimization and Performance Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive analysis and simulation of a stock portfolio to identify optimal investment weights using historical data, Monte Carlo simulations, and financial metrics like Sharpe ratio and risk-return analysis.

## Libraries Used
pandas
numpy
yfinance
matplotlib

## Features

Fetches historical stock prices for selected portfolio and benchmark (e.g., S&P 500)

Visualizes historical price trends and normalized performance

## Calculates:

Log returns

Daily and annualized returns

Covariance and correlation matrices

Constructs portfolio with:

Equal weighting

Random weighting

Simulates 1000 portfolios using Monte Carlo simulation

Plots the Efficient Frontier

## Identifies:

Optimal portfolio (max Sharpe ratio)

Least efficient and minimum risk portfolios

Plots Capital Allocation Line (CAL) and Tangency Portfolio

Compares portfolio performance vs. index benchmark

Shows capital allocation and portfolio value growth over time
